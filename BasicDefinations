👉Strong Support from Facebook: Regular updates, bug fixes, and resources from Facebook ensure React stays up-to-date and reliable.
👉Vast Community Support: React benefits from a large community, providing enough resources, tutorials, and troubleshooting help.
👉Excellent Performance: React’s efficient Virtual DOM ensures fast rendering and high performance for web applications.
👉Easy Testing: React’s structure and tools make testing simpler, improving code reliability and maintainability.

2:- What is state :- 
State in React refers to a built-in object that holds data or information about a component. It determines how a component renders and behaves. When the state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated data.
